# Vakaplan

Vakaplan is a job application tracker designed to help candidates streamline their job search process. It allows users to create personalized job search tracks (e.g., for UI Designer or Frontend Developer roles), track the status of each application, and follow a checklist to prepare for interviews ‚Äî all within a clean and intuitive interface.

Vakaplan is open-source and serverless. You can fork it, self-host it with Firebase, and securely store your job search data without relying on third-party databases.
